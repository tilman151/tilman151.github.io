Often, these dashboards are hacked together in record time to meet a presentation deadline.
Now imagine this: you built a dashboard for showcasing your latest model to your team.
Instead of your go-to tool, &lt;a href="https://streamlit.io/"&gt;Streamlit&lt;/a&gt;, you decided to try out &lt;a href="https://fastht.ml"&gt;FastHTML&lt;/a&gt;, a shiny new framework that promises better handling and scalability if your dashboard ever needs to go bigger.
Your team lead is so impressed with your model that they want to show it to the whole company.
That is your chance to shine!
With FastHTML, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about scaling to a bigger audience.
But wait: are you sure your dashboard is really working as expected?
How can you be certain nothing fails if the CEO happens to use it?
Normally, you would go for automated testing, but after scouring the FastHTML documentation on how to do it, you found nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
