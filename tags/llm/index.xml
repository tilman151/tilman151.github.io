The tech bubble is full of articles and think pieces that either promise a brave new world of software engineering or the downfall of the craft.
And let&amp;rsquo;s not talk about all the companies that are shoving AI features in the faces of their customers if they want them or not.
I am not even the first one to comment on this.
Rants about AI are now as ubiquitous as the technology itself.
AI is everywhere, and this is why I want to talk about why I don&amp;rsquo;t use it to write this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Letting AI Write a Newsletter with n8n</title><link>https://krokotsch.eu/posts/ai-newsletter-with-n8n/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krokotsch.eu/posts/ai-newsletter-with-n8n/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a member of an orchestra in my hometown since childhood.
Although I only get to play my chosen instrument a few times each year, I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the orchestra&amp;rsquo;s board.
Due to my profession, most things that can be done digitally fall into my domain.
I do not particularly enjoy these administrative tasks, but somebody has to do them.
One of these tasks is especially bothersome: &lt;em&gt;writing the weekly newsletter&lt;/em&gt;.
This newsletter is an e-mail with all important dates for the week, reminders, and an outlook of events in the next few weeks.
The newsletter is also cross-posted into the orchestra&amp;rsquo;s WhatsApp group chat.
Compiling this newsletter means checking several sources for information and bringing them together in a few well-written paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
