Although I only get to play my chosen instrument a few times each year, I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the orchestra&amp;rsquo;s board.
Due to my profession, most things that can be done digitally fall into my domain.
I do not particularly enjoy these administrative tasks, but somebody has to do them.
One of these tasks is especially bothersome: &lt;em&gt;writing the weekly newsletter&lt;/em&gt;.
This newsletter is an e-mail with all important dates for the week, reminders, and an outlook of events in the next few weeks.
The newsletter is also cross-posted into the orchestra&amp;rsquo;s WhatsApp group chat.
Compiling this newsletter means checking several sources for information and bringing them together in a few well-written paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
