I came about it in a blog post about alternative engineering practices on &lt;a href="https://daily.dev"&gt;daily.dev&lt;/a&gt;, which I obviously forgot to bookmark and, therefore, cannot mention here (nevermind, &lt;a href="https://newsletter.manager.dev/p/5-engineering-dogmas-its-time-to"&gt;found it&lt;/a&gt;).
For the people who do not know Rian Singer (I was among them before reading the book), he is a product strategist at 37signals, the company that builds Basecamp.
The Shape Up book details the project management process of the same name used at 37signals.
As a longterm admirer of Basecamp, I was immediately intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
