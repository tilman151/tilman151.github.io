As some may read in my bio, I am doing my PhD in the field of predictive maintenance (PDM).
This field is directly adjacent to machine learning and fell, like many others, into the grasp of the deep learning hype.
Unfortunately, long series of sensor readings are not as interesting to look at as images or intuitively understood as natural language, so PDM is not as present in the mind of the general ML crowd.
Maybe this post can shed a little light on this corner of the research world.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
